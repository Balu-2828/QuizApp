Overview

QuizApp is a Java-based console application that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and receive a score at the end.
It demonstrates strong fundamentals of Core Java, OOP, collections, modular design, and clean coding practices.

This project is ideal for showcasing Java skills for job applications, interviews, and assessments like Cognizant GenC.

Features
✔ Multiple-choice questions
✔ Score calculation
✔ Object-Oriented design (Question class, encapsulation)
✔ Uses Java Collections (ArrayList)
✔ Validates user input
✔ Modular structure (separate methods for loading questions & running quiz)
